# Data Structures and algorithms reference implementations

## About

This is a library of data structures and algorithms implemented in python. The idea
behind this repo is to have reference of data structures and algorithms (and whatever
may come along) implemented by me, in the way that I write code, in a language I am very 
familiar with. This way, if I need them again, they will be easier to understand. I will
be using traditional versioning for this, as it doesn't make sense for a reference.
Instead, I will use an update log
